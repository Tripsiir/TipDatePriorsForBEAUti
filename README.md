# TipDatePriorsForBEAUti

Python script to add tip date sampling support to BEAUti .XML files.

Developed for BEAST 2 v2.4.2.

=====

The purpose of this utility is to simplify the process of enabling tip date sampling in BEAST 2. It provides an automated method for embedding the required fields in .XML files that were generated by BEAUti. More specifically, it can specify prior distributions for dated sequences, initialize sample operators for these calibrations and add logger entries for the leaf heights.

This implementation is based on the following guide that is provided on the BEAST 2 website: http://beast2.org/2015/06/09/sampling-tip-dates/.
